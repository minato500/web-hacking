# Vulnerability Identification

Vulnerability Identification involves in the finding of vulnerabilities in the web applications usually caused by the misconfiguration and outdated software that could cause unauthorised access. Before stages we identified the endpoints and the attack surface, now the work to find the vulnerabilities in the application.

The vulnerability identification is done by both manual process or automated process. Automated tools are faster to identify the vulnerability.

## Manual Process 

### Default Credentials

Some applications uses the third party software, these software are published with a default username and password for administrative access (eg admin:admin) which is need to be changed in the usage but few organization forgot or move with a default password which makes it vulnerable 

So In the recon stage we have gathered the information of the third party software used, the documentations of these third party software reveal the default credentials 

### Outdated software

For the better security the organization should update the software or application they use and some software contains vulnerability which should be patched immediately. If it does not done properly it could leads to a threat. As we gained the version of the software used in the web application using recon, scanning and enumeration (eg banner grabbing), with these information we can identify the vulnerabilities in the application 

- [exploit-db](https://www.exploit-db.com/) which contains the CVE for the vulnerable software
- [metasploit](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework) is also used to list the CVE for the vulnerable software 

```
 // example usage
msfconsole
search apache 2.4.4 
```

- Google search with the version (eg apache 2.4.4 exploit) also reveal the CVE which may contain exploit code in github 

## Automated Process

Automated Process are done by automated tools which interact with the target application and scan the application and finds the application vulnerability 

The tools used for automated process are

- [nuclei](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei)

```
nuclei -target https://target_url
```

- [nikto](https://github.com/sullo/nikto)

```
nikto -h https://target_url
```

- [nessus](https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus) which would need to pay for effective uses 

## Best Practices 

After finding the CVE or vulnerability just search in google there is any manual script to exploit these vulnerability (usually github contains the manual script to run with proper usage). Another method is using metasploit-framework with contain the exploit script for these vulnerability but the metasploit-framework make much noise in the target application network so the manual exploit code is preferred but it too contain heavy noisy traffic so make it clear before using it
