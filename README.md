![web-hacking](web-hacking.png)

Web hacking is the exploitation of vulnerability that exists in a web application. This could leads unauthorised access to modify, delete, or access the data. Web hacking or bug bounty is carried out by series of phases.

## Stages of Web hacking

- [Information Gathering](stages/information_gathering.md) (Reconnaissance) - Collection information about the target without or with interaction
- Scanning and Enumeration - Identifying live hosts, open ports, technologies, subdomains and directories
- Vulnerability Identification - Detecting potential weaknesses and misconfiguration
- Gaining Access (Exploitation) - Using the identified vulnerabilities to compromise the system
- Reporting (for bug bounty) - Documenting the findings with Proof Of Concept (POC) and remediation steps

## Top Web Application Vulnerability

- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Access Control Vulnerabilities 
- Authentication Vulnerabilities
- SQL Injection
- Path Traversal
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
