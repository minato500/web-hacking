# Web Hacking

Web hacking is the exploitation of vulnerability that exists in a web application. This could leads unauthorised access to modify, delete, or access the data. Web hacking or bug bounty is carried out by series of phases.

## Stages of Web hacking

1. Information Gathering (Reconnaissance) - Collection information about the target without or with interaction
2. Scanning and Enumeration - Identifying live hosts, open ports, technologies, subdomains and directories
3. Vulnerability Identification - Detecting potential weaknesses and misconfiguration
4. Gaining Access (Exploitation) - Using the identified vulnerabilities to compromise the system
5. Reporting (for bug bounty) - Documenting the findings with Proof Of Concept (POC) and remediation steps

## Top Web Application Vulnerability

2. Access Control Vulnerabilities 
3. Authentication Vulnerabilities
4. SQL Injection
5. Path Traversal
6. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
