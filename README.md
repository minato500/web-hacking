# Web Hacking

![web-hacking](web-hacking.png)

Web hacking is the exploitation of vulnerability that exists in a web application. This could leads unauthorised access to modify, delete, or access the data. Web hacking or bug bounty is carried out by series of phases.

## Stages of Web hacking

- [Information Gathering](stages/information_gathering.md) (Reconnaissance) - Collection information about the target without or with interaction
- [Scanning and Enumeration](stages/scanning_and_enumeration.md) - Identifying live hosts, open ports, technologies, subdomains and directories
- [Vulnerability Identification](stages/vulnerability_identification.md) - Detecting potential weaknesses and misconfiguration
- [Gaining Access](stages/gaining_access.md) (Exploitation) - Using the identified vulnerabilities to compromise the system
- Reporting (for bug bounty) - Documenting the findings with Proof Of Concept (POC) and remediation steps

## Top Web Application Vulnerability

- [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](vulnerabilities/cross_site_scripting.md)

- [Authentication Vulnerabilities](vulnerabilities/authentication.md)
- SQL Injection
- Path Traversal
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
