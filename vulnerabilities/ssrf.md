# Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

Server Side Request Forgery occurs where the application makes requests on the attacker behalf.  It does this by taking a URL or partial URL from the user and then making a request to that endpoint. Usually it is refers to the internal resource (example admin dashboard)
